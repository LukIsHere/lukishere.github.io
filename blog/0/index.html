            <p class="label">Begining</p>
            <p>Oryginally called minecraft'er</p>
            <p>MCPP came to be thanks to simple idea of playing minecraft on discord. As a begining programmer i was looking for cool projects to work on and that was it.</p>
            <img class="image" src="./oldui.png">
            <p>Oryginal codebase was written in javascript but was later rewritten in C++ to "boost performance". At that time it was easier for me to write less shitty/slow code the lower (level) i went.</p>
            <p>First version of bot was very basic and slow due to <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits">discord limit rate</a> which blocks bot if it sends too many requests per second (the more players the slower it was)</p>
            <img class="image" src="./oldranking.png">
            <p>Bot from the begining had a ranking ot can be seen on the picture above</p>
            <p class="label">Web port</p>
            <img class="image" src="./mcppweb.png">
            <p>Some time later MCPP got very primitve <a target="_blank" href="https://lukishere.dev/minecraft-er-web-/">web port</a> with source code on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LukIsHere/minecraft-er-web-/">github</a></p>
            <p>It wasn't really anything special but later i managed to port entire world <a target="_blank" href="https://lukishere.dev/subprojects/mcpp/">generator to Web</a> (head to seed section)</p>
            <img class="image" src="./generator.png">
            <p>After playing game players were give their world seed and could check out entire world they had just been exploring</p>
            <p class="label">End of life</p>
            <p>Before the end of bot's life i managed to:</p>
            <p>implement nether dimension</p>
            <img class="image" src="./mc.gif">
            <p>moved from normal messages to embeds which have higher character limit there for allow having bigger screen</p>
            <p>switch from reaction based controll to <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#buttons">button</a> base controll which are limited on the client (user) side as a result bot wasn't slower anymore while more players played</p>
            <p>add skin system there was limited amount of skins but still something cosmetic was nice</p>
            <p>write per player inventory, every block broken by player was put in their inventor, there was a plan to add crafting and shop and stuff</p>
            <p>introduce building up mechanism leting you place block form inventory under player in order to get up</p>
            <p class="label">Conclusion</p>
            <p>Overall the bot was awesome project to work on. If i've managed to monetize it back then (without being evil) i would till propably work on it today.</p>
            <p>I am not planning to comback to this project for now. Unless someone is interested in paying me for maintaing it and shaping as they desire :3</p>
            <p>Either way the entire codebase is available under MIT license on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LukIsHere/mcpp/">github</a></p>
